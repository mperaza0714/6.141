While I weep--while I weep!
Thus much let me avow--
While I weep--while I weep!
Them with a tighter clasp?
All that we see or seem
O God! can I not grasp

And I hold within my hand
Yet if hope has flown away
In a vision, or in none,
O God! can I not grasp
O God! can I not save
I stand amid the roar
In a vision, or in none,
O God! can I not save
In a vision, or in none,
And I hold within my hand
But a dream within a dream?Yet if hope has flown away
And, in parting from you now,
Is it therefore the less gone?
Through my fingers to the deep,
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not grasp
I stand amid the roar
That my days have been a dream;
